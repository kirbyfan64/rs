\# expand the input numbers (1 to _, 2 to __, 3 to ___, 5 to _____, etc.)
(\d+)/(_)^^(\1)

\# setup the arena
\# duplicates the series of underscores but removes the first underscore in the second copy
\# for instance, _____ would become _____ ____ (5 underscores followed by 4)
_(_+)/_\1 \1

\# this is the magic part
\# we repeat the first set of underscores the length of the second times
\# and repeat until we end up multiplying by 1
\# the 5 underscores would go from:
\# _____ ____
\# to
\# ____________________ ___ (5*4 = 20 underscores)
\# to
\# ____________________________________________________________ __ (20*3 = 60 underscores)
\# to ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _ (60*2 = 120 underscores)
+_(_+) _(_+)$/(_\1)^^((^^_\2)) \2

\# now we remove the trailing underscore and space
 _$/
 
\# and convert back into a number
(_+)/(^^\1)
