\# Subtracts two space-delimited numbers.
\# This does NOT work with negative numbers.
\# First, expand them into underscores (as always).
(\d+) (\d+)/(_)^^(\1) (_)^^(\2)
\# First case: the numbers are equal.
\# The result must be zero.
\# We can get rid of the underscores now to prevent the rest of the cases from
\# matching.
^(_+) \1$/@0
\# Second case: the first number is larger than the second.
\# If we are subtracting 5 and 4, then the underscore form would be
\# _____ ____.
\# Therefore, the first set does *not* fit into the second.
\# We can swap the two underscore sets if the first doesn't fit into the second.
\# We also prepend an @ to signify that the resulting number will be positive.
^(_+) (?!\1)(_+)/@\2 \1
\# When we get here, the smaller will be before the larger.
\# We can now find the difference between the two.
(_+) \1(_+)/(^^\2)
\# Now, if there is no @ in the beginning, the result must be negative.
^(?!@)/-
\# Lastly, we remove the leading @, if it was there.
@/
